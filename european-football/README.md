Annotation
----------

**European Football** (also known as **Soccer**) is one of the most popular games in Europe.
Football is a big market with revenues of **€27.6 billion** in 2020/21 ([source](https://www2.deloitte.com/hr/en/pages/press/articles/annual-review-football-finance-2022.html)).
The money is earned by, e.g., selling tickets to matches and rights to broadcast games,  participating in betting, and advertising.

The game includes a lot of randomness but in some situations **data-based approach can give additional valuable information** about the game.
In this project, **European Football** data from seasons 2008/2009 to 2015/2016 was analyzed to get a better **data-driven understanding** and resolve nine interesting questions about this game.
